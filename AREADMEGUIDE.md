# SpiralTower
Videogame prototype for individuals with Asperger's Syndrome.

Source code for the Spiral Tower prototype. The prototype contains six modules that showcase the mechanics on which the final product would be built upon.
Note: The demo intentionally uses both spanish and english text.

Game explanation:

-The abstract:

--The core idea of Spiral Tower is to give the player absolute, concrete and precise knowledge of a very big, complex map filled with interactions and to allow it to 
plan its journey through it down to the very minimal details. Altough the map of the tower would say it all from the start, the factors and the inner interactions 
between them would be so many that either the player would, at one point of the other, be very likely forced to adapt its plan due to unforeseen circunstamces and 
to put all of its  investment at stake, or just fail in the execution of one of its many challenges and be forced on another path. It would require major levels 
of investment to play correctly, but at the same time it would reward players for developing the mother of all virtues: patience.

-The concrete:

--The player would be presented with a the absolute information of a complex tower that the character has to go through from room to room, and would have to plan 
its journey accordingly. Each room would offer an unique event. The tower would present the player with hazards such as traps, combats, danger zones that 
would require precise inputs, etc, and the character itself would have energy problems or the like. After clearing each section of the tower, the player wins 
and is presented with another section until it reaches the top.

Demo Modules:

-Main Menu Module: The first screen the player sees when the prototype starts up.

--Options: Mock options menu. Allows to enter light mode, meant for individuals with high ambience sensitivity.

--Start: Mock start menu. Would allow the player to create an account and start the game.

--Credits: Would showcase credits to contributors.

--Demo: Allows the player to access the other demo modules.

-Battle Module: Demo combat against a similar enemy. Showcases basic combat mechanics.

--Parry: Allows the player to automatically dodge incoming attacks for a period of time, while the character looks green. After two seconds the character becomes red,
and cannot use Parry anymore until it becomes white again. Triggered by touching the left side of the creen.

--Charge&Shoot: Allows the player to charge, then to shoot at the enemy from a distance. The first time the screen is touched the character starts charging, the second time the character shoots towards the enemy. If the enemy is too far, then this attack only stalls them, but if it's close enough then the enemy is defeated. Triggered by touching the right side of the screen.

-Cutscene Test Module: A simple cutscene showcase.

-Lobby Module: The lobby area of the game where the player would spend most of its time planning.

--Station: Holds various utility stations.

---Information: Allows the player to check on various logs and entries about the world, it's characters, and the game's mechanics.

---Inventory: Allows to player to review their items and to use them to create new ones.

---Options: Mock options menu similar to the one on the main menu.

--Setup: Allows the player to configure the character. Not available on the demo.

--View: Lets the player analyze the Spiral Tower's hologram at the center of the van. This hologram would have precise information on each of its rooms and sections.
In the demo, the hologram can be accomodated by touching the screen and moving the finger over the screen.

-Dialogue Scene Module: A simple dialogue showcase.

-Run Jump Module: A minigame example. These would always require precise input and reaction from the player, yet the player would always know exactly what to expect
from each of them.

While rough and bare, the core point of this prototype is to get an idea across. The idea is that of a game where planification and patience would reign supreme,
and spontaneity and impulsiveness would get the player to waste their time in vain. In times like this, where distraction is so easy to obtain, patience should be 
rewarded over anything else. Everything else is born from it.
